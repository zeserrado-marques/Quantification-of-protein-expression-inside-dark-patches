# Quantification-of-protein-expression-inside-dark-patches

This macro was used in an unpublished paper. It yields the mean gray value of channel 2 signal inside the dark patches present in channel 1. It uses channel 3's signal to restrict the ROI creation of dark patches inside the channel 3's domain, which represent the tissue of interest.

Please try the macro for yourself using the available dataset. Images are courtesy from Catarina Gaspar - csgaspar@igc.gulbenkian.pt
